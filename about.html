            Hello! My name is Alina Nesimi, and I am a Computer Science student at Rutgers University. 
            I am passionate about understanding the intersections across computer exploring areas such as cybersecurity, 
            artificial intelligence, data science, and software engineering. I believe responsibility is essential to success, 
            and I aim for clarity, quality, and follow through in every decision. I am seeking an internship where I can contribute 
            to real features, learn from feedback, and grow. Outside of computer science, you can usually find me baking, lately 
            perfecting Dubai chocolate brownies and sharing them with friends!
